    <h1>What is Astro<span>Drishti</span> ?</h1>
    <p>
      AstroDrishti is an initiative where we are trying to help people by making them alert about their future. Our goal
      is to provide this service at a very low price.


      We analyze your Kundlis and help you in your journey to attain success in your life. AstroDrishti will be your
      companion in good as well as those bad times.

      As we truly believe that somehow the planets have influence on us and if we understand the divine science of
      Astrology then life can become a lot easier.
      <br> <br>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-family: Roboto;">ASTROLOGY IS JUST A FINGER POINTING AT REALITY.</h4>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Horoscopes and general predictions can help you broaden your horizons and have a better understanding of current
      events. Whether it's your job, college stress, or relationship issues, astrology can help you gain a better
      understanding of the world.
      <br> <br>
      While astrology may not have an answer for everything, it can help you prepare for specific emotions or events
      that may arise in your life. 
      Planets and houses may be the first things you see in your horoscope, but what exactly do they mean? In our solar
      system, there are eight planets. In astrology, however, the Sun and Moon are also considered (totaling 10
      planets).
      The planet that most people are familiar with is your sun sign, also known as our "zodiac sign." Match your birth
      month and day to the astrological sign that corresponds to your solar sign. Sun positions convey the essence of
      who
      you are. It has to do with your personality, ego, and outward appearance.

        Influence of different planets on all of us.
      </h2>
      <br>
      The eight planets that make up our solar system are really lesser-known locations. Within your birth chart, the
      planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto all have various meanings.
      <br> <br>
      <h3>Moon</h3>
      Your moon sign corresponds to the month and day of your birth, yet it might be difficult to match your moon sign
      precisely because it changes frequently. Your emotions and the side of yourself that you keep concealed are
      represented by moon signs.
      <br> <br>
      <h3>Mercury</h3>
      Mercury is renowned as the planet that "thinks." You may be aware of the Mercury retrograde phenomenon, which has
      become a running gag in the astrological world. For many people, this experience is extremely challenging since it
      disrupts our ability to interact as humans.
      <br> <br>
      <h3>Venus</h3>
      Venus is the planet of "love." It usually refers to physical characteristics, hobbies, and attractiveness. Venus
      gives us the ability to notice the beauty in particular things and regulates our attraction to them.
      <br><br>
      <h3>Mars</h3>
      Mars is the planet of "passion." Anger, sex, confidence/self-image, and motivation are all under its influence.
      <br><br>
      <h3>Jupiter</h3>
      Jupiter is more concerned with the good elements of life,
      such as benevolence, personal development and wealth.
      <br><br>
      <h3>Saturn</h3>
      Saturn is associated with the most difficult parts of
      life, such as loyalty, strength, ethical difficulties, productivity, and general life challenges.
      <br> <br>
      <h3>Uranus</h3>
      Uranus is the planet of "individualism." It battles for your authentic self, soul, and voice. Neptune is the
      planet
      of "dreams." It represents calm, tranquillity, and transformation and is linked to the core of sentient
      spirituality. Finally, Pluto is the planet of transition, and he is in charge of your destiny and the development
      of
      your highest self.
      <br> <br>
      <h3>Neptune</h3>
      Neptune displays our imagination, psychic sensitivity, and mystic connection – all that is invisible and unknown.
      Neptune's position in the birth chart corresponds to the areas of our lives where we refuse to be constrained by
      beliefs or tradition.
      <br><br>
      All of these planets interact with your natal chart, which includes the month, day, and time of your birth. Each
      planet will link to an astrological sign, which will indicate how you function in these specific areas. If my Mars
      planet is in Scorpio, for example, my personality's passion will be fierce and severe. This is due to the fact
      that Scorpios are already known for their passion and boldness.
